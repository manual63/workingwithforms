# This project is for leanring how to work with forms

Learning to work with React useForm and also useContext to better understand them.

In this repo:

- useForm: This includes registering fields and reseting form
- useFormContext: To show that I can access deeply nested components without props drilling
- useContext: To show that I can update a global state, in this case the users name in the layout component
- reactRouterDom: Simply to have navigation so I can use a layout component for multiple views
- generic components: I created generic action buttons that can be reused


This repo is simply a way to make things much simpler so learning and understanding these concepts is easier.
